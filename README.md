 ###                                  **DnsSnap**
------------------------------
DnsSnap is a fast , lightweight dns managing app that lets you save and use dns 
DnsSnap has neat features

- Saving Dns
- Customizing the app 
- being Open Source  

--------
you : ok that's basic as fuck why should i use this app instead of other dns management apps ?

- WELL THATS A GREAT QUESTION 

how about i start with the fact that 
**_DnsSnap is not ugly_ ?**
and it doesn't look like its made for windows 7
 _ehm dns jumper_
 
its quick fast and lightweight so it wont slow your pc and it still looks good
u know what's better ?
- u can customize it 
- its open source 
- and you don't even need to use the GUI with our tray icon
-  I'm gonna update it to even look cooler and work better

also although i spent about 1 day debugging there still might be bugs (0.01% chance)

here's some pictures of the default look (with u can change)
